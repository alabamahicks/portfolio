  			<h2>Introduction</h2>
 			 <p>I'm a front-end developer, specializing in inventory-management applications for the last 3 years.  That work centered around iOS devices until this year, when our small team was asked to <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pinch-hit">'pinch-hit'</a>, shipping a mobile-ready web app on an aggressive schedule.  So I'm rediscovering web dev and remembering how engrossing CSS is!</p>
  
 			 <p>I'm constantly honing my skills - I'm always aiming to be to be relevant, competent, reliable, and fast!  I love helping businesses design and build systems that get the right job done.</p>

 			<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
 			<p>I've lived in the American Southeast most of my life, but have moved around between beach and mountains, big city and farmland.</p>

 			<h2>More About Me</h2>
  			<h3 class="question">What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  			<p><em>Great food</em> is a big part of my life, and I prefer to find it in beautiful surroundings.  Failing the view, I'll settle into a gorgeous movie.  I keep "computer crone" syndrome away with yoga practice and frequent floor sitting.</p>
    		<h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
  			<p>My dream job allows me to use my design education and experience from my architect's practice to build beautiful digital systems with a strategic eye on the big business picture, and to keep up with state-of-the-art tech.  I get to identify needs and requirements, analyze priorities, build implementations and plan reuse....and play with CSS!</p>
    		<h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
  			<p>The dancer in me is a sucker for a great torch song! I enjoyed a recent <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/07/30/427711119/jason-isbell-has-conquered-fear-but-hes-still-learning-about-family">NPR interview</a> with Jason Isbell on his "Something More Than Free".  At work you'll catch jazz in my headphones; <a href="http://www.norahjones.com/">Norah Jones</a> is a favorite.</p>

				<h1>Portfolio</h1>
			</header>
			<img>
			<p>I enrolled in Thinkful's Front End Development course largely due to this project: because I work full-time on corporate web apps, I needed to feel accountable to a structure that would work for me, and be guaranteed to yield my own valuable assets.</p>

				<h1>Clone Karma Homepage</h1>
			</header>
			<img>
			<p>Since an essential part of a web developer's job is replicating a visual, this assignment from Thinkful's Front End Development course required copying the home page used by the startup <a href="http://thinkful-ed.github.io/karma-clone/" alt="See Karma's old homepage">Karma</a>.  This activity practiced more complex layout ideas and introduced further web development resources.  Also at this point in the course, we began the habit of sharing work progress via GitHub.</p>

				<h1>Hack the NYT</h1>
			</header>
			<img>
			<p>Part of the Front End Development course offered by Thinkful, this exercise required using in-browser developer tools to "hack", or reverse-engineer a complex working site, in order to experiment with well-structured, terse code.  I learned how powerful small changes can be on the New York Times' site...for example, the mustard areas were all created by one change, in one place.</p>

				<h1>Responsive About Me Page</h1>
			</header>
			<img>
			<p>This first exercise in the Thinkful's Front End Development course began to break down some out-of-date habits I brought to the course, and familiarize me with current semantic layout and best practices.  In the course, we circled back and made it responsive to small screens, which is a frequent requirement.</p>
